# Changelog — core (libtracer reference implementation)

All notable changes to the **public API** of the `core/` reference implementation
(the headers under `include/libtracer/`) are recorded here, per
[CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) / [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md). This tracks the
*implementation's* C++ API — which is implementation-defined per
[ADR-0013](../docs/adr/0013-v1-scope-boundaries.md) and versioned independently of
the immutable **protocol-v1** wire format it implements.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The
reference implementation is pre-1.0; everything currently lives under
`[Unreleased]`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`graph::Graph::write(Vertex*, const FieldPath&, View)`** — a handle-based
  field-write so the control surface (`:settings.*`, `:subscribers[]`) is also
  string-free on the hot path: parse the path once (`Path::parse`), resolve the
  `Vertex*` + `FieldPath` once, then reuse them — no string parse, no map lookup
  per call. The string/`Path` overloads now route through it.

- **M5 — UDP socket transport.** The first transport that crosses the kernel
  network stack; the bridge/router/graph above it are unchanged.
  - `<libtracer/transport_udp.hpp>` — `UdpTransport(bind_port, peer_host,
    peer_port) : Transport` over POSIX UDP. `send` = `sendto`; an internal receive
    thread (`SO_RCVTIMEO` for clean shutdown) drains the socket into the receiver.
    One datagram = one whole frame (no stream reassembly), so it pairs with the
    flat decoder. `ok()`, `local_port()`. Validated raw + end-to-end through the
    full Graph+Bridge+ROUTER stack over localhost UDP (`tests/udp_test.cpp`);
    TSan/ASan/UBSan clean.
  - **`Bridge` perf/correctness:** the mount target is now resolved to a `Vertex*`
    once at `set_mount` (atomic) instead of a per-frame key copy + map lookup —
    faster, and data-race-free against the transport's receive thread (the mount
    vertex must be registered before `set_mount`).

- **M4 — first transport + bridge.** Two nodes talk over a "wire" (P2 bridge
  conformance); no sockets yet — an in-process loopback transport.
  - `<libtracer/transport.hpp>` — the `Transport` seam (`send` + `set_receiver`)
    and `PeerId` (the 16-byte ROUTER `origin_peer_id`).
  - `<libtracer/loopback.hpp>` — `LoopbackChannel`/`LoopbackEndpoint`, a dev/test
    transport over an in-memory channel with per-endpoint receive threads.
  - `<libtracer/router.hpp>` — `RouterMeta`, `router_wrap`/`router_unwrap` for the
    ROUTER envelope (docs/reference/05 §0x0D): NAME-tagged origin/ts/hop_count +
    the wrapped data TLV last; LL-aware emit, zero-copy unwrap.
  - `<libtracer/bridge.hpp>` — `Bridge`: `export_vertex` (egress — subscribe →
    ROUTER-wrap → send), ingress (unwrap → recent-set dedup on `(origin, ts)` →
    `hop_count`/`kMaxHops` termination → write the bare TLV to the mount vertex),
    `set_mount`/`set_recent_set_capacity`/`set_reforward`.
  - `examples/two_node_loopback.cpp` — node A publishes, node B receives over the
    loopback wire (encode→ROUTER→decode roundtrip). `tests/bridge_test.cpp` covers
    golden ROUTER, two-node delivery, dedup, and `hop_count` cycle termination.
    TSan/ASan/UBSan clean.

- **M3b — L4 subscriptions, dispatch, and the in-process P0 node.** Completes the
  in-process graph: pub/sub fan-out + field-write control surface.
  - `graph::Graph::subscribe(src, target)` and `subscribe(src, callback)` — a write
    to `src` fans out (a `SegmentPtr`-clone, no byte copy) to each target vertex
    (spec-faithful SUBSCRIBER re-dispatch) and/or in-process callback.
  - Field-write via `Graph::write(Path, View)` when the path has a field tail:
    `:subscribers[]` (append a SUBSCRIBER TLV target), `:subscribers[N]`
    (unsubscribe), `:settings.<field>` (QoS scalar update). `:schema` read returns
    a `POINT` descriptor.
  - `graph::Subscriber` and `kMaxDispatchDepth` (the in-process cycle bound,
    [ADR-0015](../docs/adr/0015-graph-runtime-concurrency-and-in-process-cycle-cap.md)).
  - `examples/in_process_pubsub.cpp` — the P0 node end to end (callback + target +
    `await` delivery), built and run as a CTest smoke test. TSan/ASan/UBSan clean.

- **M3a — L4 in-process graph runtime (core).** The data API per ADR-0006:
  `read` / `write` / `await`, keyed on canonical PATH-TLV payload bytes.
  - `<libtracer/status.hpp>` — `graph::Status` (the documented protocol error
    codes) and `graph::Result<T> = std::expected<T, Status>`.
  - `<libtracer/path.hpp>` — `graph::Path::parse` (canonical PATH payload bytes +
    `:field.sub[N]` tail, validated/canonicalized per `docs/reference/03`) and the
    `PathKey`/`PathKeyHash` vertex-map key.
  - `<libtracer/vertex.hpp>` — `graph::Vertex` with `Role` {stored-value, stream,
    handler}, `Settings` (core QoS), and the `Handlers` (`on_read`/`on_write`) seam.
  - `<libtracer/graph.hpp>` — `graph::Graph`: `register_vertex`, `read`/`write`/
    `await` (lock-free LKV read/write via an atomic `shared_ptr` swap; per-vertex
    condvar for blocking `await`), and `history` for streams. Validated race-free
    under TSan, leak/UB-free under ASan+UBSan (`tests/graph_test.cpp`). Subscriber
    fan-out + field-write follow in M3b.

- **M2 — L0/L1 memory substrate.** The layer that owns the lifetime of the bytes
  M1's borrowed `Tlv` points at; makes the zero-copy claim safe, not just fast.
  - `<libtracer/backend.hpp>` — `MemBackend`, the small user-implementable
    allocation seam (subclass it to bind any allocator / arena), and `IoDir`.
    Each backend declares its own concurrency/coherency contract (ADR-0012).
  - `<libtracer/segment.hpp>` — `Segment` (refcounted bytes + backend) and the
    intrusive `SegmentPtr` handle. Uses the canonical intrusive_ptr orderings
    required by `docs/reference/02-graph-model.md` (increment `relaxed`,
    decrement `acq_rel`). Build with `-DLIBTRACER_NO_ATOMIC` for single-threaded
    / Cortex-M0 targets (plain integer refcount; no cross-thread sharing).
  - `<libtracer/mem_heap.hpp>` — `mem::heap_backend()`, `mem::heap_alloc()`: the
    owning host allocator backend.
  - `<libtracer/mem_borrowed.hpp>` — `mem::borrow()`, `mem::borrow_const()`: wrap
    caller-owned bytes with a no-op-on-bytes destroy. The transparent
    byte-router / live-raw MVP (ADR-0012).
  - `<libtracer/mem_pool.hpp>` — `mem::Pool`: a bounded fixed-slab backend over a
    caller-owned buffer; `alloc` returns `nullptr` on exhaustion (BACKPRESSURE).
    The free list is threaded through the slab — no auxiliary allocation.
  - `<libtracer/view.hpp>` — `View` (zero-copy `(segment, offset, length)`
    window; copy = clone) and `view_as_tlv()` (the L1→L2 cast: a TLV is a cast
    from a view).
  - `<libtracer/rope.hpp>` — `Rope` (a chain of views spanning segments):
    `concat`, `walk`, `to_iovec` (scatter-gather egress), `flatten` (one-copy
    materialize).

- **M1 — protocol-v1 wire codec.** The L2/L3 borrowed (zero-copy) codec.
  - `<libtracer/tlv.hpp>` — `Type` (the `0x01`–`0x0D` registry) and the `Opt`
    options bitfield (decode/encode, reserved-bit rejection).
  - `<libtracer/crc.hpp>` — `crc::crc32c()` (Castagnoli, default) and
    `crc::crc16_ccitt()`; header-only, `constexpr` tables.
  - `<libtracer/frame.hpp>` — the `Tlv` model (`Tlv`, `Trailer`, `Timestamp`,
    `Crc`), `decode()` (→ `std::expected<Tlv, Error>`, iterative, depth-capped,
    CRC-verified), `encode()`, and `equal()`.
  - `<libtracer/tracer.hpp>` — umbrella header including the whole public API.
