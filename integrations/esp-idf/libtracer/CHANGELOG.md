# Changelog — libtracer ESP-IDF component

Notable behavior changes of the `integrations/esp-idf/libtracer` component (the
ESP-IDF packaging of the `core/` reference implementation plus the chip-native
platform links: `httpd_ws_link_t`, `twai_link_t`), per
[CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md). The core C++ API itself is tracked in
[core/CHANGELOG.md](../../../core/CHANGELOG.md).

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **`httpd_ws_link_t` no longer goes silently deaf on a failed WebSocket send.**
  Previously the TX work callback ignored the `httpd_ws_send_frame_async` result,
  so a send failure (e.g. a large fragmented frame timing out the socket's 5 s
  `SO_SNDTIMEO`) left the session open while the peer silently missed frames.
  Now a failed send logs a warning and **triggers the session's close**
  (`httpd_sess_trigger_close`, flowing through the normal `free_ctx` teardown),
  so the client's `onclose` fires and it can reconnect into clean state.
  Likewise, TX enqueue drops (`httpd_queue_work` refused / work-item OOM) — which
  were silently discarded — are now logged and counted per session; a session
  accumulating `kMaxConsecutiveTxDrops` (3) consecutive drops with no successful
  enqueue in between is treated as broken and closed the same way. Clients that
  held a connection during TX failure will now observe a disconnect instead of a
  half-dead session.
